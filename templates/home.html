          <p>
            We grew up in America and love our culture. After growing reading Amar Chitra Kathas and Tinkle comics,
            we always felt the best stories were the ones we heard from our grandparents while laying in bed. 
          </p>
          <p>
            These stories usually started out with "A long long time ago, one day there lived a king...", and we were hooked.
            The stories that were passed down to us in this way taught us the values and heritage that hold our culture together
            in a new context and a different time. They also instilled in us timeless values that we aspire to in our daily lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started Parampara to making learning about culture fun and engaging for children in a contextually relevant way.
            We would talk about common shared experiences: like our festivals, food, and common activities. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Shalini chose to bring together beautifully illustrated children's books (courtesy of Ameya's crazy skills)
            with activity kits that can engage children and help them fall in love with the characters that make up our folklore.
